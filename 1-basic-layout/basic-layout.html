            <div><h3>The Grid Container</h3></div>
            <div>CSS Grid Layout introduces a 2D grid system to CSS. Grids can be used to layout major page areas or small user interface elements.</div>
            <div>A grid container is created by declaring <b>display: grid</b> or <b>display: inline-grid</b> on an element.</div>
            <div>All direct children of that element will become grid items.</div>
            <div>Auto-placement algorithm lays out grid-children-elements, one in each grid cell.</div>
            <div>Grid creates a single column grid for the items unless explicitly specified. Extra rows are created as needed (implicit grid).</div>
            <div>Gutters or alleys (i.e. margins) between grid cells can be created using the grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap properties, or the shorthand grid-gap.</div>
